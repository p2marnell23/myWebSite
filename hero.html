    Steven Spielberg is a famous film director, known for producing blockbuster hits such as Jurassic Park, Jaws, E.T., and Indiana Jones. He was born on December 18, 146 in Cincinnati, Ohio, although he spent a significant part of his youth in Arizona. He started making amateur films when he was young and he was hired by Universal when he was just 16. By the late 1980's Spielberg was a household name with numerous hit films.

    He is one of my heroes because he revolutionized the film industry and his works are still masterpieces to this day. He was able to make films that captured themes from childlike wonder to primeval fears, while also creating beautiful worlds with masterful cinematography. Not only that, but he is continuing to direct films at 73 years old. Just two years ago, he directed a hit film called Ready Player One. Because I am interested in film, Spielberg is a good example for me on how to succeed as a director, and I strive to be as great as him.
